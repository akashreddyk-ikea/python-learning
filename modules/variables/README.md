### 1. Assignment Files

Inside the cloned repository branch -> feature/learning-variables, you will find the following files:

- `variables.py`: This is a Python file where you will write your code for the assignment.
- `README.md`: The instructions and guidelines for the assignment (this file).

Inorder to have the latest version of the repository in your local git, follow the below commands.

        1. git pull
    
            gets the latest version of the repository.
    
       2. git checkout feature/learning-variables
    
            moving to the assignment branch to work on the assignment.
    
       3. Now you can start to work on this. Refer to the below comments for more details.

### 2. Completing the Assignment

Open the `variables.py` file in your preferred code editor. You will see a set of tasks with instructions, comments, and placeholders for your code.

Your task is to complete the Python code for each task according to the instructions provided in the comments. The tasks will cover topics such as:

- Basic syntax: Print statements, comments, and indentation.
- Data types: Numbers, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Variables: Assigning values and reassigning values to variables.
- Operators: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

Write your code in the corresponding sections, following the instructions carefully. Feel free to create new variables and experiment with the concepts as you work through the tasks.

### 4. Testing Your Code

After completing each task, you can run the `variables.py` file to test your code. Use the following command in the terminal:

python module/varibles/variable.py


### 5. Commit and Push

Once you have finished all the tasks and verified your code, it's time to submit your work. Follow these steps:

- Add your changes to the staging area:

- Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

- Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
