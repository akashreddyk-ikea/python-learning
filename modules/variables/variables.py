# Task 1: Basic Syntax
# Print "Hello, World!" to the console

# Task 2: Comments
# Add a comment in this section to describe your favorite programming language.

# Task 3: Indentation
# Write a Python function called "multiply" that takes two arguments and returns their product.
# Don't forget to use proper indentation!

# Task 4: Numbers
# Create two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them any numerical values of your choice.
# Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) on these variables.
# Print the results to the console.

# Task 5: Strings
# Create a variable called "message" and assign it a string containing your favorite quote.
# Print the value of the "message" variable to the console.

# Task 6: Lists
# Create a list called "fruits" with the names of your favorite fruits (at least three).
# Print the list to the console.

# Task 7: Tuples
# Create a tuple called "colors" with the names of different colors (at least five).
# Print the tuple to the console.

# Task 8: Dictionaries
# Create a dictionary called "person" with the keys "name", "age", and "city".
# Assign your name, age, and city to the corresponding keys.
# Print the dictionary to the console.

# Task 9: Variables Reassignment
# Create a variable called "x" and assign it any numerical value of your choice.
# Reassign the variable "x" to a different value.
# Print the final value of "x" to the console.

# Task 10: Arithmetic Operators
# Write a Python function called "calculate_total" that takes three arguments: price, quantity, and tax_rate.
# The function should calculate the total price by adding the product of price and quantity to the tax amount (tax_rate * price * quantity).
# Return the total price from the function.
# Test the function with some example values and print the result.

# Task 11: Comparison Operators
# Write a Python function called "is_even" that takes an integer as an argument and returns True if the number is even, False otherwise.
# Test the function with some example values and print the results.

# Task 12: Logical Operators
# Write a Python function called "is_eligible" that takes two boolean arguments: age_over_18 and has_id.
# The function should return True if both age_over_18 and has_id are True, otherwise return False.
# Test the function with different combinations of values and print the results.

# Task 13: Assignment Operators
# Create a variable "counter" and set its initial value to 10.
# Use assignment operators to perform the following operations:
# - Increment the counter by 5
# - Multiply the counter by 2
# - Divide the counter by 3
# Print the final value of the counter to the console.

# Task 14: Bonus (Optional)
# Explore Python's "input" function and create a simple program that takes the user's name as input and greets the user.
# Print a personalized greeting message to the console.

# Task 15: Bonus (Optional)
# Create additional tasks to practice other Python concepts you've learned!
